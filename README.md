# Playwright E2E Tests for Sauce Demo

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate end-to-end tests for the Sauce Demo e-commerce application. The tests cover various user functionalities such as logging in, adding items to the cart, removing items, sorting products, and completing the checkout process.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```ini
SAUCE_USERNAME=standard_user
SAUCE_PASSWORD=secret_sauce
```

These variables are used for authenticating with the application during tests.

## Running Tests

- **Run all tests in headed mode (visual browser execution):**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headed
  ```

- **Run tests using a single worker (useful if you encounter concurrency issues, especially in Firefox):**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headed --workers=1
  ```

- **Run tests in debug mode (step through the execution for troubleshooting):**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --debug
  ```

```

## Configuration Details

- **Parallel Execution:**  
  The Firefox project is configured to use a single worker to avoid concurrency-related timeouts. Refer to the `playwright.config.ts` file for details.

- **Global Test Hooks:**  
  A 2-second wait is enforced after each test via the `setupTest.ts` file to help with consistent cleanup before the test browser closes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Timeouts or flaky tests:**  
  Try running tests in isolation (`--workers=1`) or in debug mode (`--debug`) to identify issues. You may also adjust the wait times in your page objects if necessary.

- **Login Issues:**  
  Make sure the `.env` file is present and correctly set up with valid credentials.
